# AI powered Twitter Bot

So, I got bored and wanted to see if I could make a completely free to use Twitter bot. As you can see, I was able to do that successfully.
I haven't fully automated the posts yet; you will need to run the script manually, but it generates posts for you and automatically posts them. 

As I continue to develop the script, I will try to add methods of having it make scheduled posts. But if the free Twitter API doesn't support it, this is the best you're going to get so far.

This is mostly proof of concept to see if I could do it.

## Description

This is a python bot that you would fully generate Tweets for you. This uses a combination of Poe (by Quora) and the free to use Twitter API.
It uses a reverse engineered Poe API in order to extract outputs from the AI and turn them into Tweets.

## Getting Started

You will need 3 things:
  - A Twitter account with Developer access to post the Tweets
      - To find your keys, watch this short video.
        - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PkacG2UYMps)
        - You will also need to make sure you set uup User authentication settings
